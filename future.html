        <p>With my mental health background, I want to help the tech industry to make better tools in order to meet the demand of the upcoming mental health needs of our ever-growing mental health-conscious society. Below are two examples of growth of the tech industry and the integration of mentalhealth/mindfulness.  My goal after finishing this program is to work with tech organizations that are centered around addressing mental health needs. </p>
